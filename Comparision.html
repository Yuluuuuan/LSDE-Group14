                    <b><p>We found that many authors’ information was incomplete.
                        <br>Some of them have no names, and some of their names contain 
                        symbols with undetermined meanings. There are also some authors whose names only have initials, and it is difficult 
                        to determine which author they are. At the same time, there are many people in China whose surnames are Wang, Zhang, or Li. 
                        Therefore, we cannot determine who that person is in Google Scholar. In other words, this data may be composed of records 
                        of different people.
                        <br>There are also cases where the author cannot be found in Google Scholar.
                        <br>The h-index in Google Scholar includes two types of data since the author’s publication and since 2016. 
                        We mainly use the data since the author’s publication.The crossref data set is in 2002, so most of the authors' h-index 
                        in Google Scholar will be higher.
                        <br>We checked the research fields of the authors in the sample and found that most of the scholars 
                        with a large difference in h-index between the two data sets are from the fields of physics and biology.</p>
